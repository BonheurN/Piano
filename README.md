Piano App
This repository contains a simple interactive piano web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a visual representation of a piano with black and white keys, styled using CSS. This app is a demonstration of creating a responsive piano interface using front-end technologies.

Features
Responsive Design: The app adjusts to different screen sizes using media queries.
Visual Piano Keys: Displays piano keys, including both white and black keys, with proper layout and styling.
Responsive FreeCodeCamp Logo: A FreeCodeCamp logo is included at the top of the piano interface, which scales with the screen size.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the piano.
CSS: For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript (Optional for further enhancements): Can be added for adding functionality, such as playing sounds when keys are pressed.
Usage
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the piano layout. The app currently displays the keys visually without sound functionality. You can extend it by adding JavaScript to simulate sound on key press or mouse click.

Responsive Design
Desktop view: The piano spans a width of 992px, providing a full-size piano interface.
Tablet and Mobile view: The piano resizes to 358px wide on smaller screens for a mobile-friendly experience.
Future Enhancements
Add sound for each piano key press.
Create hover effects for key interactions.
Implement keyboard support to play notes via physical keyboard presses.
